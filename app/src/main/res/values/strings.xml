    <string name="bio">Hi my name is Ed.
        \n\nI love fish.
        \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in  aquarium or river, or lake and definitely the ocean.
        \n\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
        \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        \n\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
        \n\nAnd even lees sometimes, I actually catch something.
        \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon  with my hands.
        \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach yoo how to how to make your own aquarium.
        \n\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n
